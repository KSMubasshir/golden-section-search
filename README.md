A MATLAB implementation of the golden section search algorithm.
## Golden Section Search 
The [**golden-section search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search) is an efficient way to progressively reduce the interval locating the minimum. The key is to observe that regardless of how many points have been evaluated, the minimum lies within the interval defined by the two points adjacent to the point with the least value so far evaluated.
